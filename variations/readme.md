## circlepacking_in_a_circle.jsx

![desc_circlepack_in_a_circle](https://github.com/shspage/illustrator-circlepacking/raw/master/variations/img/desc_circlepack_in_a_circle.png)

**USAGE** : Select a circle (or already drawn circles in a circle), and run this script.

In this variation, I added some restriction in moving range to the original script.
It is still based on Euclidean geometry.

Because of the restriction, it seems that the convergence is relatively slow.
So I set a large value for "max_dist_err_last_phase_threshold" -- one of the optional values.
The error can be small enough after the last phase, or it can't be.
Please note that **the final error can be noticeable.**
You can continue the process for adjusting, by selecting circles and running this script again.
Considering the usage like this, I added the process that excludes the outer circle from the selection.
So you can select it with circles.


## circlepacking_in_a_circle_web.js

![desc_circlepack_in_a_circle_web](https://github.com/shspage/illustrator-circlepacking/raw/master/variations/img/desc_circlepack_in_a_circle_web.png)

This is a variation of circlepacking_in_a_circle.jsx which draws on HTML5 canvas.  
You can see the transition of convergence with its animation.
